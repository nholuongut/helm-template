**If you are using a recent version of Helm, you do not need this anymore!**

`helm template` is now a built-in part of Helm. Just run `helm template --help` with your existing Helm.

# Helm Template Plugin

This is a Helm plugin to help chart developers debug their charts. It works like
`helm install --dry-run --debug`, except that it runs locally, has more output
options, and is quite a bit faster.

## Usage

Render chart templates locally and display the output.

This does not require Tiller. However, any values that would normally be
looked up or retrieved in-cluster will be faked locally. Additionally, none
of the server-side testing of chart validity (e.g. whether an API is supported)
is done.

```
$ helm template [flags] CHART
```

### Flags:

```
      --notes               show the computed NOTES.txt file as well.
      --set string          set values on the command line. See 'helm install -h'
  -f, --values valueFiles   specify one or more YAML files of values (default [])
  -v, --verbose             show the computed YAML values as well.
```


## Install

```
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/nholuongut/helm-template
```

The above will fetch the latest binary release of `helm template` and install it.

### Developer (From Source) Install

If you would like to handle the build yourself, instead of fetching a binary,
this is how recommend doing it.

First, set up your environment:

- You need to have [Go](http://golang.org) installed. Make sure to set `$GOPATH`
- If you don't have [Glide](http://glide.sh) installed, this will install it into
  `$GOPATH/bin` for you.

Clone this repo into your `$GOPATH`. You can use `go get -d github.com/nholuongut/helm-template`
for that.

```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nholuongut/helm-template
$ make bootstrap build
$ SKIP_BIN_INSTALL=1 helm plugin install $GOPATH/src/github.com/nholuongut/helm-template
```

That last command will skip fetching the binary install and use the one you
built.
